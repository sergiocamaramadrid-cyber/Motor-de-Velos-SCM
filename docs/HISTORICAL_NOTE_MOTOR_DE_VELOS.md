## Preservation of Context

This document records the conceptual foundation of the *Motor de Velos* framework.
It serves as a historical and philosophical introduction to the ideas that motivated
the technical development contained in this repository.

The objective of this note is preservation of authorship and conceptual lineage.
All scientific validation, statistical evaluation, and reproducible procedures are
implemented in the main repository and described in the technical README.

## Conceptual Overview

The Motor de Velos proposes a fluid–dynamic interpretation of cosmic structure.
The universe is considered not as static vacuum but as a dynamic pressure field
in constant motion.

Within this conceptual view:

- Galactic rotation emerges from structured pressure gradients.
- Localized energy generation is interpreted as condensation phenomena within
  pressure centers.
- Residual matter (referred to conceptually as "inert veil") is stabilized by
  active pressure dynamics.

This repository does **not** rely on narrative statements for validation.
All empirical evaluation is performed through reproducible statistical pipelines,
including SPARC rotation curve analysis, fixed out-of-sample protocols, and AICc
model comparison.

## Technical Scope

The historical perspective presented here is distinct from the
computational implementation.

The repository focuses on:

- Reproducible evaluation of rotation-curve behaviour.
- Explicit statistical testing (OOS, AICc).
- Transparent dataset handling.
- Documented validation diagnostics.

Readers interested in the reproducible framework should refer to:

- `README.md`
- `docs/SPARC_EXPECTED_BEHAVIOUR.md`
- `CITATION.md`

## Statement

This note is preserved as part of the intellectual development of the framework.
Scientific conclusions remain strictly tied to reproducible computational evidence
and declared statistical protocols.
